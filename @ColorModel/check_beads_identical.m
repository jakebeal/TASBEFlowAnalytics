%  [ok ratios] = check_beads_identical(CM, file, tolerance)
%  Loading 'file' as FCS data, tests whether the bead peaks found are
%  within tolerance of the bead peaks for the color model.
%  Tolerance is an optional argument, defaulting to 0.5
%
%  Returns a boolean 'ok' indicating whether all chanels passed
%  and a set 'ratios' of the relative shift between peak sets
